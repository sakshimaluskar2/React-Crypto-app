# Description
Developed a cryptocurrency tracker web application using React and Chart.js, integrating real-time data through the CoinGecko API for market analysis and price charts. Built responsive UIs with Chakra UI and ensured smooth navigation using React Router. Optimized performance through state management with React Hooks and Axios for secure data fetching.
# Overview of the Project:
I developed a cryptocurrency tracker web application where users can track the live prices, market data, and trends of various cryptocurrencies in real-time.
# Technologies Used:
I used React to build the interactive user interface, which made the development process faster and more modular. I also used Chart.js to create visual price charts, which helped in displaying cryptocurrency trends clearly. React Router was implemented for smooth navigation between different pages like price details and market stats. For UI components, I relied on Chakra UI, which allowed me to build a clean and responsive design with minimal effort.
# Data Handling and API Integration:
To retrieve real-time market data, I integrated the CoinGecko API into the app, using Axios to handle HTTP requests. This allowed me to display live cryptocurrency prices and their market statistics dynamically on the app.
# State Management and Performance Optimization:
For state management, I used React Hooks to maintain the state of data, such as currency prices and user preferences. This made the application more efficient by reducing unnecessary re-renders. I also optimized the performance by using memoization and lazy loading components where necessary.
# Challenges Faced:
One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the data was up-to-date in real time without overloading the app. I implemented polling and debouncing techniques to reduce excessive API calls and improve performance.
# Outcome:
As a result, the application is fast, responsive, and provides users with a smooth experience when tracking and analyzing cryptocurrency prices, which can be customized based on individual preferences.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
